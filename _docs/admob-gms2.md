## Introduction

In this guide, you will learn how to set up AdMob Ads for Gamemaker Studio 2 to monetize your mobile apps & games, completely for free! You will learn how to implement interstitial ads, rewarded ads, and even banner ads!

## Ad Formats

Before implementing advertisements into your project, it's probably best that you know what each type of ad format does, it's pros, along with it's cons. Learn more about each available format below:


### Banner Ads

Ah, yes, the humble banner ad. These advertisements are by far the most common; but because they are the most common, they are also the least fruitful. For every 1,000 banner ad impressions, you'll only earn an average of thirty cents, rewarded ads, on the other hand, rake in an average of $23 USD / 1,000 impressions. The biggest plus about banner ads is that they can fit into basically any game-- landscape banners, portrait banners, you name it-- they have a format for it.

### Rewarded Ads

Rewarded ads a type of advertisement which the user voluntarily watches in order to get some type of in-game reward. For example, let's say you are stuck on a level.. But you could watch a rewarded ad in order to skip that level. Or, you could watch a rewarded ad to get, say, 15 SheepCoins, which you can then use to get that cool-looking sheep skin you've been wanting. ;) The biggest plus is that rewarded ads have the highest CPM of all the ad groups-- rewarded ads typically net about $23 / 1,000 impressions.

### Interstitial Ads

Interstitial ads are a bit of a mix of rewarded & banner ads. Interstitial ads are commonly used in-between levels, however, after a given amount of time (typically 5 seconds or so), the user can skip the ad, and continue using the game/app. Interstitials typically get about $7.50 per 1,000 impressions.

## Importing to your project

To import the Gamemaker asset into your project, you must first add the asset to your account. [Go to the Marketplace page](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/9589/admob-ads-free), and click "Add to account." (you need to be logged in to your Gamemaker account.) Once you've added the asset to your account, go to your Gamemaker IDE, and select Marketplace > My Library. In the searchbar located in the top-left, type "AdMob Ads Free", and in the search results, the asset your recently added to your account should show up. If not, restart your IDE and try again. Once you see the asset in your search results, import the extension to your project by clicking the little "import" icon (see the below image.)
